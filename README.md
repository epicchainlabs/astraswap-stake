Sure! Here's a **much longer and more professionally styled** version of your original `AstraSwap-contract-swap` documentation. It's been transformed into a rich, structured, and comprehensive format suitable for technical documentation or a `README.md` file for developers and community contributors.

# 💱 **AstraSwap Swap Contract**  
*Powering Decentralized Trading & Liquidity Across the AstraSwap Ecosystem*

---

## 🔍 Overview

**AstraSwap Swap** is the decentralized heart of the AstraSwap ecosystem — an advanced **on-chain Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocol that seamlessly enables the exchange of wrapped assets, **XEP**, and other **XEP-5 based tokens** within a trustless, permissionless, and composable environment.

This contract is designed with **modularity**, **security**, and **efficiency** in mind, ensuring AstraSwap users and liquidity providers experience minimal slippage, robust token compatibility, and high-performance liquidity provisioning. The underlying model used is the **Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM)** — a mathematical approach that maintains a balance between two tokens in a liquidity pool, guaranteeing that the product of their reserves remains constant during each trade.

> ⚠️ Note: At the early stages of AstraSwap's evolution, only **whitelisted token pairs** will be supported to ensure system stability and audit readiness.

---

## 🧠 What is a Constant Product Market Maker?

The **CPMM** model is defined by the formula:  
```
x * y = k
```
Where:
- `x` = reserve of Token A  
- `y` = reserve of Token B  
- `k` = constant product (does not change after a trade)

This principle was made popular by protocols such as [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works/), and forms the foundation of many modern decentralized exchanges.

The beauty of CPMM lies in its **simplicity** and **resilience**: it enables any user to trade two assets by interacting with a liquidity pool, without requiring a traditional order book or a centralized matching engine.

## 🔗 Key Components of AstraSwap Swap Contract

### 1. 🧬 Liquidity Pools
Each supported pair of tokens has its own dedicated **Swap Pool Contract**, maintaining a ledger of reserves and ensuring the `x * y = k` condition is always met. Liquidity providers can:
- Deposit an **equal value** of both assets into the pool
- Receive **Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens** representing their share
- Redeem LP tokens later to withdraw their portion of the pool (plus accrued trading fees)

### 2. 💸 Trading Engine
Swaps are performed by calculating optimal input/output amounts via the CPMM formula. The contract includes:
- **Slippage control** to protect traders
- **Minimum amount thresholds** for trade validity
- **Fee distribution** to liquidity providers

### 3. 📦 Wrapped Asset Support
The contract natively supports **wrapped tokens**, including bridged assets and tokenized versions of external cryptocurrencies. These wrapped assets expand AstraSwap’s utility, enabling cross-chain DeFi experiences.

### 4. 🛠️ Admin & Governance Tools
- Whitelist management for token pairs
- Adjustable swap fee parameters (via DAO proposals)
- Emergency pause/resume functions for contract safety

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

1. **Token Swaps**  
   Instantly exchange XEP for wXEP or any other approved token pair on-chain with no intermediary.

2. **Liquidity Provision**  
   Deposit equal values of XEP and wXEP into the liquidity pool and receive LP tokens as proof of ownership.

3. **Yield Farming (Upcoming)**  
   Stake your LP tokens in AstraSwap’s farming contracts and earn additional rewards in ASTRA or other tokens.

4. **Cross-chain Gateway**  
   Use wrapped assets to transfer value seamlessly between different blockchains and trade on AstraSwap.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧮 The CPMM Equation
Let’s say you want to swap XEP for wXEP. The pool currently holds:
- `x = 1000 XEP`
- `y = 2000 wXEP`

So `k = 1000 * 2000 = 2,000,000`.

You want to buy `wXEP` by providing `100 XEP`. The new reserve for XEP becomes `1100`, and the new reserve for `wXEP` is calculated using:
```
y_new = k / x_new = 2,000,000 / 1100 ≈ 1818.18
```

So you receive:
```
2000 - 1818.18 = 181.82 wXEP
```

This simple but effective algorithm ensures liquidity remains balanced at all times.

## 🔐 Security & Audits

AstraSwap Swap Contract is developed with rigorous security principles and will undergo the following before mainnet deployment:

- ✅ Static analysis using tools like MythX and Slither
- ✅ Manual audit by third-party security firms
- ✅ Continuous fuzz testing and testnet bug bounties
- ✅ Timelocked contract upgrades and DAO-approved governance proposals
